# About The Project

The objective of this project is to forecast the price of diamonds by considering their diverse characteristics, including Color, Clarity, Cut, Table, Depths, and Dimensions.\n
carat - Weight of the diamond \n


cut - Quality of the cut(Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color - Colour of the diamond, from J (Worst) to D (Best)
clarity - How clear the diamond is, from I1 (Worst) to IF (Best)
x - Length in mm
y - Width in mm
z - Depth in mm
depth - Total depth percentage. Formula =z / mean(x,y)
table - Width of top of diamond relative to the widest point
price - Price in US dollars
