## Features
- **Predictive Model**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast diamond prices based on attributes like carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions.
- **Modular Codebase**: Organized and modularized code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Integration with DVC**: Data Version Control (DVC) is integrated for efficient data management and versioning.
- **Integration with MLflow**: MLflow is integrated for experiment tracking, model management, and reproducibility.
- **Integration with DagsHub**: DagsHub is used for collaboration, sharing, and versioning of machine learning projects.
- **Integration with GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions is employed for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Integration with Airflow**: Airflow is used for workflow orchestration and automation.

## About The Project

The objective of this project is to forecast the price of diamonds by considering their diverse characteristics, including Color, Clarity, Cut, Table, Depths, and Dimensions. <br><br>

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| carat     | Weight of the diamond |
| cut       | Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal) |
| color     | Color of the diamond, from J (Worst) to D (Best) |
| clarity   | How clear the diamond is, from I1 (Worst) to IF (Best) |
| x         | Length in mm |
| y         | Width in mm |
| z         | Depth in mm |
| depth     | Total depth percentage. Formula: z / mean(x,y) |
| table     | Width of top of diamond relative to the widest point |
| price     | Price in US dollars |


## Dataset Used

This dataset used for this project is Diamond dataset taken from Kaggle.
