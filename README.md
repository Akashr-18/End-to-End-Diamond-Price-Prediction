# About The Project

The objective of this project is to forecast the price of diamonds by considering their diverse characteristics, including Color, Clarity, Cut, Table, Depths, and Dimensions. <br><br>
carat - Weight of the diamond <br>
cut - Quality of the cut(Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal) <br>
color - Colour of the diamond, from J (Worst) to D (Best) <br>
clarity - How clear the diamond is, from I1 (Worst) to IF (Best) <br>
x - Length in mm <br>
y - Width in mm <br>
z - Depth in mm <br>
depth - Total depth percentage. Formula =z / mean(x,y) <br>
table - Width of top of diamond relative to the widest point <br>
price - Price in US dollars <br>
